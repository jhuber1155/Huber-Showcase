# Huber Showcase

## A portfolio of the work I can offer you!

This showcase is a portfolio of the projects I have completed in the past demonstrating both my competence and capability when it comes to various coding projects under a variety of systems, languages, and techniques. My hope is that it will allow you, as a potential employer, to determine if the skills I have to offer can meet any of the needs your current projects may have.

This portfolio allowed me to flex my creative coding muscles while allowing you a rubric to judge if I may be a good fit for your team and your projects. This portfolio is also a site I can keep updating with continuing educational materials. When I learn a new system, or a new language, I can add it to this portfolio as well as my mental toolbox. It is a cyber manifestation of what I have learned as well as what I am currently learning.

This portfolio currently uses HTML and CSS exclusively, but I hope to add more (like Javascript) in the future to bring more personality and style to the elements found within. I learned about styling, flexboxes, and image manipulation to get the background video in place and working. I also learned a bit about sourcing images with the alt tag and linking to items both within the current webpage itself (like the about me and contact me button) as well as to other pages (like my deployed github page on the first application).

## Installation

To deploy this site, log onto [Github Pages](www.github.com)

## Credits

This portfolio was made with the help of my instructors and my fellow students in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. Other helpful resources came from [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

I had particular help with the background video and image resizing thanks to the following:

Chris Coyier at [CSS-Tricks](www.css-tricks.com/full-page-background-video-styles/)

Dudley Story at [The New Code](http://thenewcode.com/777/Create-Fullscreen-HTML5-Page-Background-Video)

I also used photos from several websites which include:
